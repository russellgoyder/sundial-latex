### Corrections from Proof folder

Page 1. At the end of the first paragraph of the introduction, there is "4 min" instead of "4 minutes". I assume you have changed this to conform with EJP guidelines, but to me seems a little abrupt in an introductory body of text!

Page 2 line 3. 'equation of time' has already been put in quotes, so there is no need for quotes here.

Page 2. The last sentence of the introduction reads "for which full details can be found" but I think it should read "of which full details can be found".

Page 2, the footnote. As it stands, the link is broken. "pagesintroduction.html" should be "pages/introduction.htm".

Page 7, just before equation 29, "shadow bearing" should be "shadow angle".

Page 8, first paragraph of section 5. "gnomon orientation" should be "gnomon's orientation".

Page 13, just before equation 54, there are two "we have"s very close together. I'd like to delete the first one, to leave "For the case considered by Rohr, iota = pi/2 - thetaL and we have".

Page 13 Equation 57. "dec" in tan dec should be a calligraphic D, the declination, defined in equation 55.
