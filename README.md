# The sundial problem from a new angle

## LaTeX source

To build, run `latexmk -pdf`. To clean up, `latexmk -C` and if you want, `find figs -name 'figure?.eps-converted-to.pdf' | xargs rm`.

### Note

Fixed a typo in figure 3 (DialFrame.fig) using inkscape which couldn't save as fig, so I saved it as DialFrame.svg.
