# The sundial problem from a new angle

## LaTeX source

To build, run `latexmk -pdf`. To clean up, `latexmk -C` and if you want, `find figs -name 'figure?.eps-converted-to.pdf' | xargs rm`.

TODO:

1. Figure 3: m_1 and m_3 should be switched
1. The sign in Rι of Eq.11 must be wrong (or n1 ∧ n3 should be n3 ∧ n1); then it gives Eq.12, otherwise Eq.12 would have to look the same as the m3 equation in Eq.10 (but there is a sign difference).
1. Published in 2006 updated blah.
